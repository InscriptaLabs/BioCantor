BioCantor
=========
A Python library that integrates flexible feature arithmetic with sequences and arbitrarily nested coordinate systems.

These core data models are then built upon to build in-memory representations of genomic intervals, including
genes, transcripts and non-coding features.

These data structures can be built from common file types like GenBank and GFF3, and exported to common file types
like GenBank, GFF3 and BED.
