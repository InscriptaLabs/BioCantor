Location
========

Overview
--------

:class:`Location` objects represent features defined with respect to a coordinate system. The :class:`Location` API
includes rich feature arithmetic methods. Additionally, a :class:`Location` object can define its relationship with
a :class:`Parent` object, situating it within a potentially arbitrary hierarchy of coordinate systems; the
:class:`Location` API provides rich coordinate and location conversion methods.
